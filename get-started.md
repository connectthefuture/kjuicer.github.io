## 1. Create your account
Creating a user makes sure that your documents will be saved under your account. They will be displayed on your Personal Wall. You create a new document when you click on the extension (see point 2 below for installing the extension) to highlight a web page (see point 4 below for setting up a page for *kjuicing*) or you upload one. With a user you can also decide if a document should be publicly visible and appear on the Public Wall or not, if its highlights should be editable by anyone or not. A document without owner is by default public, and its highlights can be edited by anyone. The account also allows you to bookmark your favorites (among your documents or among others') from the info menu at the bottom right of every *kjuiced* page, by clicking on the star icon of the info window. Starred, or favorites, appear in your Favorites Wall.

At present you can login only through Google. Former Mozilla Persona accounts can still use the login they created in the past, but since Persona has been deprecated they will have to reset their password. A blog post is dedicated to explain this simple procedure.

To create or access your user through Google click on the login button in the top right corner of any Kjuicer page (for example <a href="http://alpha.kjuicer.com/cache/4549/show/#l:1,c:on" target="_blank">Kjuicer</a>), choose Google and allow Kjuicer permission to access your basic Google account credentials.

## 2. Install the extension or...
The extension allows you to cache a standard web page and turn it into a page that can be highlighted with the Kjuicer.

The Kjuicer currently works best on Firefox or Chrome, and we have developed an extension for both browsers.
To install, please choose your relevant link:
- [Firefox extension][kj1]
- [Chrome extension][kj2]

As soon as you install the extension you will see a stylized juicer button on your browser's toolbar. When you find a web page that you would like to highlight with the Kjuicer, click on it: you will be brought to a page ready for highlighting. If you have an account and are logged in, the page will be automatically saved on your *Personal Wall*.

## 3. Read a *kjuiced* page
If you have a page that has already been highlighted with the Kjuicer, you can read it by clicking on the colored dots at the bottom:
> the **yellow** dot will bring you to the shortest summary, or what has been higlighted in yellow;

> the **light green** button will show you a larger summary, composed of the yellow and light green highlights, while

> the **dark green** button will propose you with all the content that has been highlighted by the author, i.e. yellow + light green + dark green highlights, which is the longest summary of the original content.

> the **white button** will bring you to the original content.

Clicking on any word or sentence in the summaries will instruct the Kjuicer to expand the content displayed at the next level of summary: a little bit like zooming in while browsing a map, it will show you more details. If you click back to a shorter summary color, the Kjuicer will get you back to the previously selected word or sentence.

In case you want to modify the highlights, click on the button *Edit* at the bottom left corner.
> If you own the document, or it is open for changes, the background of the navigation bar will turn white
> and you will be able to select the desired highlighter.

> In case you don't own the document and it is not open for change by others, you will be prompted if you
> want to **fork** it, i.e. copy it and create your own version, which will still have the highlights available
> for editing.

## 4. Highlight a *kjuiced* page
As soon as you click on the Kjuicer extension or the bookmark, or you choose *Edit* on a *kjuiced* page, the background of the navigation bar will turn white and you will be able to select the desired highlighter.

Once you have selected your color it will stay until you change your choice, and any text you select will be highlighted in the desired color.

You can change color by clicking on a different one, or also by using the keyboard shortcuts: 1 activates the yellow highlighter, 2 the light green one, 3 dark green, 4 activates the white one, which is the eraser.

In order for the summarizing mechanism to work properly and to allow it to create your prioritized notes and different sized summaries, you should highlight the text keeping in mind that:
> the text you highlight should be re-readable all by itself, including necessary spaces and punctuation;
> yellow should be used for the most important concepts, light green for supporting parts, dark green for >everything else that you want to make note of;

**When you are done highlighting**, or want to check the resulting summaries click on the **check** button at the bottom left corner.

**If you made a mistake** you can use the **undo** or **redo** buttons at the right of the bottom bar.
