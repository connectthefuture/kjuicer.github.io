summary: How to access to your KJuicer account if you are still using Mozilla Persona as authentication method
lang: en
---
## Persona will be shut down

The persona.org services run by Mozilla will be shut down on November 30th 2016. This change will affect KJuicer users that use Mozilla Persona as authentication method.

## How to migrate

In order to continue to access to these accounts, an easy migration procedure has been developed. Mozilla Persona users are requested to [set a new password](http://alpha.kjuicer.com/admin/password_reset/) associated with theirs email address and log in with a regular KJuicer account.

## Alternatives

KJuicer currently provides registration and access using the Google OAuth2 authentication method, but we are planning to add new methods and provide better integration between accounts and popular credential providers.

## Support
